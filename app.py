st.sidebar.markdown("""
* All values are in today's dollars (no inflation adjustment).
* Investment returns are pre-tax (but super is generally taxed at 15% in accumulation, 0% in pension phase after age 60). This model assumes net returns in pension phase.
* Age Pension and Tax rules are based on **July 2025** rates for **homeowners**.
* Super withdrawals after age 60 are tax-free. Only Age Pension is taxable income.
* For **couples**, all super balances and income figures entered/projected are **combined** for the couple. The Age Pension calculation is based on combined assets/income, and tax is calculated as if the Age Pension is split evenly between two individuals, each applying their own SAPTO and tax thresholds relevant for a couple.
